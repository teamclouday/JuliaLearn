# Julia Learn  

A project to learn & practice [Julia](https://julialang.org/)  
By implementing multiple popular ML algorithms  

"Learn" is for both learning the language, and Machine Learning

------

### Note 
The code in this project are mainly for learning and practicing purposes, not for practical use  
For practical ML libraries in Julia, I recommend using [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/)
